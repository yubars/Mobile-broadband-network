Following are the scripts that I have used to measure and analyze MBB performance parameters. 
interfaceinfo.py
pathinfo.py
client.py
server.py
gpsdata.py
Among these scripts, two base scripts are: interfaceinfo.py and pathinfo.py. Main measurement scripts are client.py and server.py that are used to measure MBB parameters. For GPS data, gpsdata.py is used. 


Scripts that are used for results and analysis are:
combine.py
mobility.py
speed.py
separate.py
connectivity.py
loss.py
